            <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
               efficient.
               I didn't
               stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know the
               deployment,
               server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

            <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed
               it
               to them.
               They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
